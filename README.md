# Multithreaded Web Server in C

## 📌 Overview
A lightweight HTTP web server written in **C** that supports multiple concurrent client connections using **POSIX threads (pthreads)**.  
This project demonstrates systems programming, networking, and concurrency handling — simulating how real web servers manage multiple requests.

---

## ✨ Features
- Handles multiple clients simultaneously using threads  
- Supports basic HTTP `GET` requests  
- Thread-safe request handling  
- Simple benchmarking against a single-threaded baseline  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: C (C11 standard)  
- **Libraries**: POSIX sockets, pthreads  
- **Platform**: Linux / macOS
